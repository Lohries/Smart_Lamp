# Smart_Lamp
  This project was use in the first semester o the computer engeneering. The content is the source code of th Arduino, the documentation with more details and the direct link to Tinkercad, that shows the simulation of it.
  A breve description to what I mean by the term "smart lamps" or "Lampada Inteligentes" (in Portuguese). The name can be explained by itself, it's a lamp that according to the light of the exterior area, in contact with a sensor, can autoregulta it's luminosity. Example: If you have a place with a lot of luminosity, the lamp will emmit a lower light, this is also true in an oposite direction, with less light, more luminosity by the lamp.
  This can be expand in a big scale and in different areas, like public enviorments, industries and home, obviously with respect changes in the format, size, power and some components.
