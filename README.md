# Smart_Lamp
  This project was used in the first semester of computer engineering. It includes the source code for Arduino, detailed documentation, and a direct link to Tinkercad, showcasing the simulation.
  A brief description of "smart lamps" or "Lâmpadas Inteligentes" (in Portuguese): The name is self-explanatory – these are lamps that automatically regulate their luminosity based on the ambient light detected by a sensor. For instance, in well-lit areas, the lamp emits lower light, and in darker environments, it increases its luminosity. This concept can be scaled and applied in various settings such as public spaces, industries, and homes. Of course, adjustments can be made in terms of format, size, power, and components to suit different requirements.
